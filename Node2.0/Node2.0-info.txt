Node 2.0 Bitcoin full node address

CPU:
The new server uses an ARM cpu believed to not be vulnerable to meltdown spectre type issues. And with it not being intel or AMD there are no known backdoors in hardware.

Storage:
The new server is using a fan cooled high capacity RAID 1 setup for storing the blockchain and other critical data.

Software securtity:
Node2.0 is reachable only by a Tor hidden service address and all outbound connections are through Tor only. It has a hsv2 and hsv3 hidden service address. The OS and as much software as possible is compiled from source. I keep the OS very minimalist and only install what is needed.

Physical security:
It is in a fairly safe location that also anonymously hosted due to being Tor only. I have security camera that allow me to be alerted on intrusion of the area. I am also using network hardware running open source firmware that the nodes sit behind. I am heavily armed (thankful for blackmarkets and 3D printers) to fend off any physical attack.

Other:
It is connected to a UPS battery backup to help protect from data loss or corruption. In the event of a short term power outage it would keep it powered until restoration and protect equipment from dirty power.
