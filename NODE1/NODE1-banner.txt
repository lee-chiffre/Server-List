My mission statement

To enhance and contribute to the security, availability,
accessibility and contingency of the bitcoin networks
infrastructure.

Security and availability by hosting, maintaining, guarding
diverse and distributed bitcoin nodes and servers using secure
hardware and software backed by physical security. Increase the
accessibility and contingency of the bitcoin network by interfacing
with multiple networks including the internet, darknets, ham
radio, sattelite. To overcome network failture or censorship for
contingency of the bitcoin network from technological, natural,
and political disasters.


My services
+ Hosting, maintaining, securing Bitcoin and Electrum servers and
services.
+ I can give you support for things relating to bitcoin. If you
have any questions relating to bitcoin, electrum, or hosting a node
you can email me. I will help where I can. I can also assist people
businesses and organizations to accept bitcoin.

I am making this my side job. Dedicating 6 hours of my time each
week to improving or maintaining servers and services to benefit
bitcoin users.

NOTIFICATIONS AND WORK LOG

Saturday 17 August 2019
I am building the OS for the new server hardware and testing the trezor
electrum build script on debian buster. And started setting up my technical operations
center. I have started training a trusted associate on bitcoin and linux administration
to help run nodes and with other bitcoin related services. Photo of the upgraded node
will be posted when complete.

Thursday 25 July 2019
I got a large harddrive for use with the weekly blockchain backups. The previous
harddrive was running low on space.

Saturday 13 July 2019
Updated donation address to bech32 native segwit address.
Made another blockchain backup.
Created software script to help people easily build electrum with trezor support
with needed dependencies.

Current improvements I am working on
+ I am getting a physical open source firewall and router to help secure the network
the node is using for an improvement to cyber security and network reliability.
+ For physical security I am getting an inexpensive open source security camera for
more security of the node from physical attacks.
+ Setting up the new server. New server uses secure hardware with an ARM
architecture CPU. And features RAID 1 setup and UPS power backup. I have two nodes
with this setup. The first one is what is going to be the new server. The second one
is used as a hardware backup in case the first one has hardware failure. If I can find
a secondary physical location I will host both of them at the same time. The new node
will also host bitcoin on the next gen Tor hidden services address.

ROADMAP
When current improvements are completed
2019
+ Lightning Network service

2019-2020
+ Get another node that uses a different software than core for diversity of node
software. Diversity is good for security. This node running alternative bitcoin node
software would act as a backup if there is ever a discovered vulnerability and mass
attack on core servers.

+ For contingency. Train and equip someone I know and trust to be able to continue
operations if something happens to me.

+ Get 2nd server setup at different location for continuity
in case one server goes down.

After the above goals are reached. Probably 2020
+ Create a guide on how to assemble and install a secure bitcoin server.
Help other people out who choose to host their own nodes but want assistance.

+ Work on I2P integration in Bitcoin.

+ Ham radio and satelite integration for availability and accessibility if the 
internet or grid goes down. Promote integration of these contingent connections with 
other node operators for increasing resiliency of Bitcoin.
