Click 'help menu' > 'Donate to server.'
Donations help fund security and upgrades of bitcoin servers and its operations.
So far donations have helped to fund the hardware for Node2.0. A security camera. A
dedicated dev board for compiling bitcoin related software. And most hardware for a
second node of the same setup. I need an estimate of $150 to finish the second node I
plan to operate at the same time as Node2.0 which would be a backup node in a different
location. This is what I plan to use donated funds for. New donations after that will
go for a low cost laptop for purposes of node administration by an associate of mine.
I plan on getting a trusted person to help with administration and hosting and
services. Having a 2nd person helping out would increase contingency of operations
and speed of improvements. If any  donor wants their donations to go to something
specific you can email me with your requests. Donations are not expected but are
welcome.

NOTIFICATIONS AND WORK LOG

January 03 2020
The harddrive array on Node2.0 was running too hot for comfort. I bought and rigged
up cooling fans to the harddrives. The bitcoin server Node2.0 is back up and running.
It is building the transaction index and catching up to the latest block.
The transaction index is needed for Electrum server.

December 29 2019
I am in the progress of setting up the development and compiling environment on a
dedicated computer. Then compiling and installing ElectrumX server, lightning network
router, joinmarket on Node2.0

December 22 2019
THE NEW NODE IS SETUP and operational.
Node 2.0 Bitcoin full node address (Does not work with electrum yet. Read note below)
zztaegcitdl7bar4.onion
pvigneuyddbxr2vhpvmukvo7rpleggo4xxhtmoh6jwlkerui44cxbnad.onion (V3 hidden service
address on bitcoin node is experimental. If you notice any connect issues please let
me know.)

CPU:
The new server uses an ARM cpu believed to not be vulnerable to meltdown spectre type
issues. And with it not being intel or AMD there are no known backdoors in hardware.
Storage:
The new server is using a high capacity RAID 1 setup for storing the blockchain and
other critical data.
Software securtity:
Like this one, the new node is reachable only by a Tor hidden service address and all
outbound connections are through Tor only. It has a hsv2 and hsv3 hidden service
address. The OS and as much software as possible is compiled from source. Using Node2.0
instead of Node1 is recommended.
Physical security:
It is in a fairly safe location that is also anonymously hosted due to being Tor only.
I have security cameras that allow me to be alerted on intrusion of the area. I am
also using network hardware running open source firmware that the nodes sit behind.
Other:
It is connected to a UPS battery backup to help protect from data loss or corruption.
In the event of a short term power outage it would keep it powered until restoration
and protect equipment from dirty power.
Note:
The new node is now a fully functional full node. It does not have Electrum Server
installed on it yet. But I am keeping Node 1 online for now while I work on getting
Electrum Server on Node2.0. If you want to use Node2.0 now you can use Wasabi Wallet
pointed to Node2.0 as an alternative in the meantime. Or just continue using Electrum
with Node1 while I get Electrum Server on Node2.0. Actually, I recommend Wasabi Wallet
over Electrum for privacy reasons. There is nothing wrong with Electrum. Electrum is an
excellent wallet. But if you do not trust the Electrum Server you are connecting to, it
has the ability to know all your bitcoin addresses. I do not store logs on Electrum or
spy on users. But security should not be reliant on trust. I plan on continuing to
operate Electrum Server as a service and help people set up their own bitcoin server if
they need assistance.

ROADMAP
2019 to early 2020
+Publish complete node setup guide to help others
create their own node.
2020
+ Continue research and development in bitcoin privacy and security

+ Lightning Network service

+ For contingency. Train and equip someone I know and trust to be able to continue
operations if something happens to me.

+ Get 2nd server setup at different location for continuity in case one server goes
down.

+ Work on I2P integration in Bitcoin.

+ Ham radio and satelite integration for availability and accessibility if the 
internet or grid goes down. Promote integration of these contingent connections with 
other node operators for increasing resiliency of Bitcoin.
