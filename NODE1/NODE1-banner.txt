My mission statement
To enhance and contribute to the security, availability,
accessibility and contingency of the bitcoin networks
infrastructure.

Security and availability by hosting, maintaining, guarding
diverse and distributed bitcoin nodes and servers using secure
hardware and software backed by physical security. Increase the
accessibility and contingency of the bitcoin network by interfacing
with multiple networks including the internet, darknets, ham
radio, sattelite. To overcome network failture or censorship for
contingency of the bitcoin network from technological, natural,
and political disasters.

My services
+ Hosting, maintaining, securing Bitcoin servers and services.
+ I can give you support for things relating to bitcoin. If you
have any questions relating to bitcoin, electrum, or hosting a node
you can email me. I will help where I can. I can also assist people
businesses and organizations to accept bitcoin.

Click 'help menu' > 'Donate to server.'
Donations help fund upgrades of the bitcoin servers. So far donations have been used
to obtain the hardware for the two new nodes and the disks for setting up RAID for
each one and for blockchain backups. If any donor wants their donations to go to
something specific you can email me with your requests.
Donations are not expected but are welcome.

NOTIFICATIONS AND WORK LOG
Ready your bitcoin battle stations nodes and wallets for Jan 3 2020 annual #ProofOfKeys
day.

SCHEDULED DOWNTIME
This server will be offline for between 30 minutes to 2 hours sometime Nov 14 or 15
for upgrades.

November 13 2019
I regained access back to github. My secmail email is working again. I am using the
airmail.cc email address as a secondary email and as a backup address. I can be reached
at any one of these two email addresses.

November 06 2019
I have been making progress on the new node and locational security. I finished
compiling the OS for the new node and it is setup and running with the new OS.
I am now working on building Tor and Bitcoin software from source then blockchain
sync from scratch. The new node uses secure hardware with an ARM architecture CPU and
uses a RAID 1 setup with UPS power backup. I have the hardware for two nodes with this
setup. I will post photos when completed. Both nodes will use a different bitcoin
software for more software diversity. Software diversity of node software is essential
for security of the bitocin network. I am working on locational securilty to help
protect the nodes from theft or tampering. And improving the security of the network
hardware the nodes sit behind. I plan to publish a guide on how I setup my node so
others can do the same if they choose to do so.

Deadline for the bitcoin operations center setup is before Jan 3 2020

ROADMAP
When current improvements are completed
2019
+Finish setup of both new nodes. Publish complete node setup guide to help others
create their own node.

2020 ideas
+Lightning Network service

+ MONERO NODE!!

+ For contingency. Train and equip someone I know and trust to be able to continue
operations if something happens to me.

+ Get 2nd server setup at different location for continuity in case one server goes
down.

+ Work on I2P integration in Bitcoin.

+ Ham radio and satelite integration for availability and accessibility if the 
internet or grid goes down. Promote integration of these contingent connections with 
other node operators for increasing resiliency of Bitcoin.
